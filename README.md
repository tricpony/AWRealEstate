Here's what you will find in AWRealEstate.

### Language ###
The project was written in Swift.

### Harvested Code ###
You may notice source file headers not matching this project.  These are from my prior coding challenge projects.

### Adaptive Layout ###
UISplitViewController is used with style doubleColumn to support all size classes.  There is one storyboard, for detail screen,
that contains a few size class variant settings.  Even though there is a growing trend to prohibit storyboards in favor of a UI in code,
for this challenge I wanted to demonstrate a proficiency in both styles.

### Device Orientation ###
Portrait and landscape is supported as specified.

### Combine ###
Combine is used to make service calls.

### Environments ###
Configurations are included to manage separate URLs.

### Known Issues ###
Xcode is not building separate apps, per bundle ID. 

### Testing ###
Some unit tests are included.
